Feature: Submit Page
  On the Submit Page, I can submit my song to morning cd. When I
  submit my song, I am brought to the Question Page.

  Scenario Outline: I am on the submit page for <name>
    When I visit the submit page with the id "<id>"
    Then I see a container with the title "Submit Listen"
    And I see the song "<name>" by "<artist>" from the album "<album>"
    And I see a field with the label "Your Name"
    And I see a field with the label "Note (Optional)"
    And the submit button is disabled
    And the name input is selected

    Examples:
      | id                     | name                                                | artist                         | album                                        |
