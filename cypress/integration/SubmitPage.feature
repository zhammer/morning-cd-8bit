Feature: Submit Page
  On the Submit Page, I can submit my song to morning cd. When I
  submit my song, I am brought to the Listens Page.

  Scenario Outline: I am on the submit page for <name>
    When I visit the submit page with the id "<id>"
    Then I see a container with the title "Submit Listen"
    And I see the song "<name>" by "<artist>" from the album "<album>"
    And I see a field with the label "Your Name"
    And I see a field with the label "Note (Optional)"
    And the submit button is disabled
    And the name input is selected

    Examples:
      | id                     | name                                                | artist                         | album                                        |

  # Test unexpected error
  Scenario: I am on the submit page for an invalid song id
    When I visit "/submit?id=invalid_track_id"
    Then I see the error text "Error! invalid id"

  Scenario Outline: I am on the submit page with bad query string "<query>" (<description>)
    When I visit "/submit<query>"
    Then I am redirected to "/question"

    Examples:
      | query      | description            |
      | id=1337    | missing question mark  |
      |            | empty query string     |
      | ?          | no query params        |
      | ?id=       | id is empty            |
      | ?id=1&id=2 | multiple ids           |
      | ?ID=1      | capitalized            |
      | /123       | route not query string |
