Feature: Submit Page
  On the Submit Page, I can submit my song to morning cd. When I
  submit my song, I am brought to the Listens Page.

  Scenario Outline: I am on the submit page for <name>
    When I visit the submit page with the id "<id>"
    Then I see a container with the title "Submit Listen"
