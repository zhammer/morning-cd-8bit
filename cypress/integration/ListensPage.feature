Feature: Listens Page
  On the Listens Page, I can see all of the songs that were posted
  to Morning CD since the last sunrise.

  Background:
    Given these tests refer to the following listens

  Scenario: I visit the listens page
    Given it is after sunset
    And listens 1-15 exist
    When I visit "/listens"
    Then I see the title "Here are the first pieces of music people listened to today, from all over the world"
    And I see the listens with the following ids
      | 15 |
      | 14 |
      | 13 |
      | 12 |
