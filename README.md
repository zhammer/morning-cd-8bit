# [8bit.morningcd.com](8bit.morningcd.com)

**What was the first piece of music you listened to this morning?**

This is the 8bit-style frontend remake of [morningcd.com](morningcd.com). You can view the original morningcd code [here](https://github.com/zhammer/morning-cd).

Eventually I'd like to get this all into one repo. Not sure when I'd be able to do that, but the general goals would be:
- Merge all of these "microservices" that I thought were so cool after reading an O'Reilly book as a new grad into one backend server. It also could be nice to use something like Hasura to serve GraphQL directly from the database.
- If possible, merge the two frontend apps (8bit and original) so that most of the logic is shared, but styles differ
- Once that's done, I'd like to make this into a more generic "make a collaborative playlist" app where folks can build a playlist for special occasions, leave personalized notes, and don't need spotify accounts to contribute
